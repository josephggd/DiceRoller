# DiceRoller
<b>Following UDACITY TUTORIAL for creating a Dice Roller app.</b>

This tutorial covers lateinit and adding images to a project.
The images, in the format of vector drawables, are stored as .xml files that can be referenced conditionally.
Lateinit enables the app to call findViewById just once and save the ImageView as a variable after `onCreate` (found in `R.id.<ImageView>`) to improve performance.
